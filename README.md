Base has common things
Folders have user-specific things

Viewing should be from a folder and should show all the things in the folder and NOT any parent folders

Common things have an extra column of 'who' based on options presented at submit-time

First row of each file defines frequency (#/week/month/year)
subsequent rows are 
date	time	(person)


date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
