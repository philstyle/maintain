you gotta maintain

Base has common things
Folders have user-specific things

Viewing should be from a folder and should show all the things in the folder and NOT any parent folders

Common things have an extra column of 'who' based on options presented at submit-time

First row of each file defines frequency (#/week/month/year)
subsequent rows are 
seconds_since_epoch	(person)





date -r${TIME} "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" #-> nice looking
